## 🎯 Prime Directive

> **Fix what exists. Polish what works. Nothing new until foundation is solid.**

This workplan guides AI agents through Nexus development. Tasks are organized into Waves with clear priorities. Items are never deleted—only moved to future waves for re-evaluation.

**Read these first:**
1. `NEXUS_MASTER_PLAN.md` — Strategic vision and governance
2. `PHASE_PLAN.md` — Phase history and version targets
3. `AI_PROTOCOL.md` — Handoff procedures between agents
4. `SCOPE.md` — What's active vs frozen
